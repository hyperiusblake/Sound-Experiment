			<img class="band-shot" src="images\IMG_9351.PNG">
			<p>Conceived by Cleveland-based artist Robin "Hyperius" Blake, the members of the Sound Experiment come from various disciplines and backgrounds. It’s been said that they can play “anything”. </p>
			<p>From jazz to neo-soul to hip-hop, the musical spectrum of the Black diaspora is represented in their arrangements, and the beauty of human diversity is represented on their roster. They seek to start conversations about freedom of expression and the intersections of identity regarding that expression, while believing in the power of music as a universal language, which transcends all boundaries.</p>
			<p>Tiptoeing the line between jam band and groove orchestra, this band aims to stimulate your mind, and inspire your heart. The Hyperius Blake Sound Experiment (HBSE) is here, and can guarantee quality sound along with their own brand of joy.</p><br>

			<p>Arranger, composer, and multi-instrumentalist Robin "Hyperius" Blake is based in Cleveland, OH. He strives to break the barriers of “genre” and embrace Black music as an infinite well of ideas from which to draw inspiration. Intersectionality, whether musical or socio-political, is a key part of his life framework.</p>
			<p>He has been a member of the Cleveland Orchestra Chorus, Mojo Big Band, and many local bands and musical organizations as a freelance musician. Robin has been commissioned for original works by Chocolate City Comics, the Re:Sound Festival, and the Cleveland Shakespeare Festival. Hyperius received his Bachelor’s in Music from Cleveland State University (2016) on a self-created degree track. His senior recital/thesis was based around the idea that hip-hop music is an extension of jazz’s legacy, and was titled “A Sound Experiment”.</p>
			<p>He is also the founder of the Creation Festival in Cleveland, which aims to showcase artists and creators of marginalized identity.</p>
